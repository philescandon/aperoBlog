## Sometimes

I fall into these rabbit holes and when I poke my head up at the end of the day... I think ' Wow ... that was cool!
'

It happened yesterday.

## Looking down the hole

It all began with thinking about retooling my CV.
I just changed teams at work and was asked to provide an updated resume.
TODO: Provide link

Of course, I did it in R - using an R Template and RMarkdown.
It looks good.
Anyhow I saw another CV from Dr. Hill and thought I'd try it.

That CV uses the **Pagedown** package.
I've used **knitr**, **blogdown**.  
I've seen **bookdown**, but not not page... wait..
?

Why can't I just use **bookdown**??  
Whats the diff?
CV as an html document..
CV delivered as a PDF...

So I look at bookdown for a moment.
Ok, easy books, served as a site..
easy editing..

I forget about my CV... and am thinking more about books now.

I am going to be writing a technical document soon, as a matter of fact.

-   How do I write technical documentation?
-   How do **we** at my aerospace company write technical documentation?
-   How does Lockheed Martin do it?
-   Boeing? Northrop Grumman? Raytheon? (My company is technically 'Raytheon Technologies' but the names have changed so much its hard for me to keep track)

So what is a book and what is technical documentation?
What the difference there?

What if I don't want to write technical book, just something for fun?

Poems?  
Short Stories?

## Falling in

Well - I don't think there is much difference between books and technical documents.

Why don't I just write a simple book and see what it looks like, try it on for size, see what are my misgivings.

So that's what I did.
It's to easy just to let this idea sit there, you have to take it out for a spin!
Kick the wheels, steer it around a corner, try to drive it off a cliff!
It doesn't hurt.

The ideas behind the **bookdown** package are ones that I stand behind.

-   Books should be easy to write

-   Books should be cheap to

    -    write

    -   update

    -   maintain

So many times I've seen documents that are red-lined , with corrections pending and one never knows if they changes make it back into the document.

Sooo..
finally I get around to looking at Dr Hill CV and her template and I see Nick Strayers CV.
Oh..
it's good.
the information displayed, the seamless integration of time with accomplishments and work, what is this small animation on the resume?

What is this D3.js??
and who uses *Javascript* for analysis?

I peer into another rabbit hole....
