This week has been busy cleaning up a few areas, selling items, downsizing.  

Seems like a perfect time to be doing this.  

I sold a lot of camera equipment, my beloved Nikon D610 - an entry level full frame camera, as well as a 70-200 mm f2.8 lens. 

I took a lot of shots with that combo over the years.  But it was ungodly heavy.  You couldn't really just go for a walk with that setup.  Much to heavy.

Now I'm looking at the Sony A7c.  A small compact, full frame.

I haven't decided yet.
